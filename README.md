# hello-world
First Repository to test and learn features of using github
This is just a sample branch to try out features of Github
I like to create similar repos for Python related projects that I'm working on
so that I can maintain the code and share with the other similar minded folks.
I'm just getting started into development although I'm a Senior Project Manager in IT Infrastructure space.
